2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO uCD[0] connects to flops which have these Mux/MuxEn[3]_i_3_n_0, OneWire/FSM_onehot_OneWireSeq[7]_i_2_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#2 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO uCD[1] connects to flops which have these Mux/MuxEn[3]_i_3_n_0, OneWire/FSM_onehot_OneWireSeq[7]_i_2_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#3 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO uCD[2] connects to flops which have these Mux/MuxEn[3]_i_3_n_0, OneWire/FSM_onehot_OneWireSeq[7]_i_2_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#4 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO uCD[3] connects to flops which have these Mux/MuxEn[3]_i_3_n_0, OneWire/FSM_onehot_OneWireSeq[7]_i_2_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#5 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO uCD[4] connects to flops which have these Mux/MuxEn[3]_i_3_n_0, OneWire/FSM_onehot_OneWireSeq[7]_i_2_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
