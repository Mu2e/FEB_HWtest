ERROR: [DRC PDRC-34] MMCM_adv_ClkFrequency_div_no_dclk: The computed value 200.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net pll_clk3) for the VCO operating frequency of the MMCME2_ADV site MMCME2_ADV_X0Y1 (cell Test_DDR_i/mig_7series_0/u_Test_DDR_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/gen_ui_extra_clocks.mmcm_i) falls outside the operating range of the MMCM VCO frequency for this device (600.000 - 1440.000 MHz). The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please run update_timing to update the MMCM settings. If that does not work, adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (40.000000), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (8.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (1), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
